Skybox

To give a perfect illusion of a beautiful sunny sky, we are going to create a simple box, but with a special texture.

Skybox

First, our box, nothing new, just take notice of the disabled backface culling:
var skybox = BABYLON.Mesh.CreateBox("skyBox", 100.0, scene);
var skyboxMaterial = new BABYLON.StandardMaterial("skyBox", scene);
skyboxMaterial.backFaceCulling = false;
skyboxMaterial.disableLighting = true;
skybox.material = skyboxMaterial;


Next, we set the infiniteDistance property. This makes the skybox follow our camera's position.
skybox.infiniteDistance = true;


Now we must remove all light reflections on our box (the sun doesn't reflect on the sky!):
skyboxMaterial.diffuseColor = new BABYLON.Color3(0, 0, 0);
skyboxMaterial.specularColor = new BABYLON.Color3(0, 0, 0);


Next, we apply our special sky texture to it. This texture must have been prepared to be a skybox, in a dedicated directory, named “skybox” in our example:
skyboxMaterial.reflectionTexture = new BABYLON.CubeTexture("textures/skybox", scene);
skyboxMaterial.reflectionTexture.coordinatesMode = BABYLON.Texture.SKYBOX_MODE;


(More about reflectionTextures can be found in our Unleash the Standard Material tutorial.)

In that /skybox directory, we must find 6 sky textures, one for each face of our box. Each image must be named per the corresponding face: “skybox_nx.png”, “skybox_ny.png”, “skybox_nz.png”, “skybox_px.png”, “skybox_py.png”, “skybox_pz.png”.

Skybox

If you want some free skybox texture samples, point your browser to: http://3delyvisions.co/skf1.htm (look at licenses before use, please.) As you can see by those examples, skybox textures need not be textures of sky alone. Buildings, hills, mountains, trees, lakes, planets, stars, you name it (all can be used nicely) as part of skybox textures.

Final note, if you want your skybox to render behind everything else, set the skybox's renderingGroupId to 0, and every other renderable object's renderingGroupId greater than zero, for example:
skybox.renderingGroupId = 0;

// Some other mesh
myMesh.renderingGroupId = 1;


More info about rendering groups and rendering order can be found here.
